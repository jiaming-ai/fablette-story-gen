    "title": "The Snow Queen",
    "original": "Have you ever heard the wind whisper secrets in winter?  Not just the whooshing kind, but a cold, sharp whisper that makes you shiver even when you're wrapped in a cozy blanket. That’s how our story begins, with a whisper of cold magic.\n\nLong, long ago, in a town where houses huddled together like friends in the snow, lived two children, Gerda and Kay. They weren't brother and sister, but they were closer than that. They shared a tiny garden box on their windowsill, bursting with bright red roses in the summer.  They read stories together, built snow forts in the winter, and their laughter was as cheerful as the tinkling bells on a sleigh.\n\nOne day, while they were looking at a picture book, Kay suddenly cried out. “Ouch!” he rubbed his eye. “Something pricked me!”  Gerda couldn’t see anything. But Kay kept saying his eye hurt and that everything looked… different.  He started to see the beautiful roses in their garden as prickly and ugly. He even started to tease Gerda, who was always so kind and sunny.  It was as if a tiny piece of ice had snuck into his eye and into his heart.\n\nThat winter was extra cold. The snowflakes danced and twirled, but they weren't playful anymore. They seemed sharp and biting. One afternoon, as Kay was playing in the snow, a magnificent sleigh, as white as fresh cream and sparkling like diamonds, glided into the town square.  A lady sat in it, wrapped in furs that shimmered like moonlight on ice.  Her face was pale and beautiful, but oh, so cold.  She beckoned to Kay with a smile that didn’t reach her eyes.\n\nKay, who had been feeling colder and colder inside, felt drawn to her. He climbed into the sleigh without a word to Gerda who was playing nearby.  The sleigh shot off like a rocket, faster and faster, the snowflakes swirling around them like a blizzard.  Gerda tried to run after them, but the sleigh was gone, disappearing into the whirling snow.\n\nPoor Gerda! Her heart felt like a block of ice itself.  Tears froze on her cheeks as she realized Kay was gone. Where could he be? And who was that cold, beautiful lady?  She remembered old Granny telling stories of the Snow Queen, a magical lady who lived in a palace of ice and snow, far, far away in the land of eternal winter.  Could it be her?\n\nGerda decided she had to find Kay. She wouldn’t let the cold, sharp whisper of winter steal her best friend.  She put on her warmest red shoes, the ones her Granny had given her, and set off on her adventure.\n\nHer journey was long and full of surprises. First, she came to a garden where it was always summer, even in winter!  A kind old woman lived there, who loved flowers more than anything. She wanted Gerda to stay and forget about Kay.  She even used magic to make Gerda forget! But Gerda's red shoes reminded her of her quest.  When she saw a rose painted on the old woman’s hat, tears welled up in her eyes, and suddenly, she remembered Kay and her promise to find him.  She ran away from the garden, even though it was so beautiful, because her heart longed for Kay.\n\nNext, she wandered into a dark, scary forest.  Suddenly, rough voices shouted, and Gerda was surrounded by robbers! They were big and fierce, with bushy beards and sharp knives. Their captain was a robber girl, just a little older than Gerda, but wild and strong.  The robber girl was going to keep Gerda as her toy!\n\nBut the robber girl had a pet – a big, shaggy raven.  When Gerda told the raven her sad story about Kay and the Snow Queen, the raven’s wise eyes softened.  “Caw! Caw! I know where the Snow Queen lives!” he croaked. “She flew over the forest with a boy in her sleigh.  He was shivering, but didn’t seem unhappy.”\n\nThe robber girl, who was actually quite lonely inside, listened to Gerda and the raven.  She had never had a real friend.  Maybe, just maybe, Gerda was different.  She decided to help Gerda. She lent her a reindeer to ride on, a big, strong animal named Bae.  And she told Bae to take Gerda as fast as the wind to the land of the Finn woman, who knew all the magic secrets of the North.\n\nRiding on Bae, Gerda travelled through snowy mountains and icy plains.  Finally, they reached the Finn woman’s hut, a small, cozy place nestled in the snow.  The Finn woman listened to Gerda’s story and told her, “The Snow Queen has taken Kay to her ice palace, far beyond the land of the Laplanders.  Only your warm heart and your innocent love can break the ice spell around him.”\n\nBae the reindeer carried Gerda even further, to the land of the Snow Queen.  The palace was magnificent, built of shimmering ice, sparkling like a million stars in the cold, pale sky.  But it was also terribly cold and empty.\n\nInside the palace, in a huge hall of ice, Gerda found Kay. He was pale and still, playing with sharp pieces of ice, trying to fit them together.  He was trying to solve a puzzle that the Snow Queen had given him – to make the word “Eternity” out of ice pieces.  If he could solve it, the Snow Queen promised to give him the whole world! But Kay couldn’t do it. The ice pieces were too cold, and his heart was too frozen.\n\nGerda rushed to Kay and threw her arms around him.  “Kay! It’s me, Gerda!” she cried.  Her warm tears fell on Kay’s chest, melting the ice around his heart.  Gerda’s love, so pure and strong, was like sunshine breaking through the winter clouds.\n\nThe ice splinter in Kay’s eye melted away, and the piece of ice in his heart shattered into tiny, harmless pieces.  Kay blinked, and looked at Gerda.  He saw her clearly, her rosy cheeks, her kind eyes filled with tears of joy.  “Gerda!” he cried, and he hugged her back, tears streaming down his own face now, warm, happy tears.\n\nThey remembered everything – their games, their garden, their laughter.  The puzzle of ice pieces fell to the floor, forgotten.  They didn’t need to solve a cold, icy puzzle to find eternity. They had found it in their friendship, in their love for each other.\n\nHand in hand, Gerda and Kay left the ice palace.  As they walked, the cold wind seemed to soften, the snowflakes danced playfully again.  Spring was coming, even to the land of the Snow Queen.  And when they finally reached their own town, the roses in their little garden box were blooming, brighter and redder than ever before, welcoming them home.  They had learned that love is warmer than any winter, and stronger than any ice spell. And that, my dear children, is a secret worth whispering in the winter wind.",
    "translation": "冬天，你有没有听见过风的悄悄话？不是那种呼呼的风声，而是一种冰冷、尖锐的低语，冷得你即使裹在暖和的毯子里，也会忍不住打哆嗦。我们的故事，就从这样一句寒冷的魔法低语开始了。\n\n很久很久以前，在一个小镇上，房子们像雪地里的朋友一样紧紧依偎在一起。住着两个孩子，格尔达和凯。他们不是亲兄妹，但比亲兄妹还要亲。他们分享着窗台上一个小小的花箱，夏天的时候，那里开满了鲜艳的红玫瑰。他们一起读书，冬天一起堆雪堡，他们的笑声像雪橇上的铃铛一样清脆。\n\n有一天，他们一起看图画书的时候，凯突然叫了一声，“哎哟！” 他揉着眼睛，“有什么东西扎了我一下！” 格尔达什么也没看见。但是凯一直说眼睛疼，而且看什么都……不一样了。他开始觉得花园里美丽的玫瑰又扎人又难看。他甚至开始嘲笑总是那么善良开朗的格尔达。好像有一小块冰碴，偷偷溜进了他的眼睛，也溜进了他的心里。\n\n那个冬天格外寒冷。雪花飞舞，旋转，但不再是嬉戏玩耍的样子了。它们似乎变得尖锐而刺骨。一天下午，凯在雪地里玩耍的时候，一辆华丽的雪橇，像新鲜奶油一样洁白，像钻石一样闪耀，滑进了小镇广场。一位女士坐在里面，裹着像月光在冰上一样闪闪发光的皮毛。她的脸苍白而美丽，但哦，多么冰冷啊。她朝凯招了招手，脸上带着笑容，但笑容并没有到达她的眼睛。\n\n凯，一直感到内心越来越冷，被她深深吸引住了。他一句话也没对附近的格尔达说，就爬上了雪橇。雪橇像火箭一样飞驰而去，越来越快，雪花像暴风雪一样在他们周围飞舞。格尔达想跑去追他们，但雪橇已经消失了，消失在呼啸的雪花中。\n\n可怜的格尔达！她的心感觉也像一块冰一样。眼泪冻结在她的脸颊上，她意识到凯不见了。他会去哪里呢？那个冰冷美丽的女士是谁？她想起了奶奶讲过的雪后的故事，一个住在冰雪宫殿里的魔法女士，住在遥远遥远的永恒冬天之地。难道是她吗？\n\n格尔达决定一定要找到凯。她不会让冬天冰冷的低语偷走她最好的朋友。她穿上最暖和的红鞋子，是奶奶送给她的那双，踏上了她的冒险之旅。\n\n她的旅程漫长而充满惊喜。首先，她来到一个花园，那里永远都是夏天，即使在冬天也是！一位善良的老妇人住在那里，她爱花胜过一切。她想让格尔达留下来，忘记凯。她甚至用魔法让格尔达忘记！但是格尔达的红鞋子提醒了她的使命。当她看到老妇人帽子上画着一朵玫瑰时，眼泪涌上了她的眼眶，突然，她想起了凯，想起了她要找到他的承诺。她跑出了花园，即使那里非常美丽，因为她的心渴望着凯。\n\n接下来，她迷失在一片黑暗、可怕的森林里。突然，粗鲁的声音喊叫起来，格尔达被一群强盗包围了！他们又高又壮，凶神恶煞，长着浓密的胡子，拿着锋利的刀。他们的首领是一个强盗女孩，只比格尔达大一点点，但野性十足，非常强壮。强盗女孩打算把格尔达留下当她的玩具！\n\n但是强盗女孩有一只宠物——一只又大又蓬松的乌鸦。当格尔达把她关于凯和雪后的悲伤故事告诉乌鸦时，乌鸦充满智慧的眼睛变得柔和起来。“嘎！嘎！我知道雪后住在哪里！” 他沙哑地叫道。“她带着一个男孩乘着雪橇飞过森林。他冻得发抖，但似乎并不难过。”\n\n强盗女孩，其实内心非常孤独。她从来没有过真正的朋友。也许，也许格尔达不一样。她决定帮助格尔达。她借给格尔达一头驯鹿骑，是一头又大又壮的动物，名叫贝伊。她告诉贝伊，要像风一样快地带格尔达到芬兰女人的地方，芬兰女人知道北方所有的魔法秘密。\n\n格尔达骑着贝伊，穿过雪山和冰原。最后，他们到达了芬兰女人的小屋，这是一个小小的、舒适的地方，坐落在雪地里。芬兰女人听了格尔达的故事，告诉她，“雪后把凯带到了她的冰宫，远远超出了拉普兰人的土地。只有你温暖的心和纯真的爱才能打破他身上的冰咒。”\n\n贝伊驯鹿带着格尔达继续前进，到达了雪后的领地。宫殿非常壮观，由闪闪发光的冰建成，像寒冷、苍白的天空中数百万颗星星一样闪耀。但也非常寒冷和空旷。\n\n在宫殿里面，在一个巨大的冰厅里，格尔达找到了凯。他脸色苍白，一动不动，正在玩弄着尖锐的冰块，试图把它们拼在一起。他正在努力解决雪后给他的一个谜题——用冰块拼出“永恒”这个词。如果他能解开谜题，雪后答应给他整个世界！但是凯做不到。冰块太冷了，他的心也冻僵了。\n\n格尔达冲向凯，张开双臂抱住了他。“凯！是我，格尔达！”她哭喊着。她温暖的眼泪滴落在凯的胸膛上，融化了他心中的冰。格尔达的爱，如此纯洁而强烈，就像阳光穿透冬天的乌云。\n\n凯眼睛里的冰碴融化了，他心中的冰块也碎成了细小的、无害的碎片。凯眨了眨眼，看着格尔达。他清楚地看到了她，她红润的脸颊，她充满喜悦泪水的善良眼睛。“格尔达！”他喊道，他紧紧地抱住了她，眼泪也顺着自己的脸颊流了下来，那是温暖、快乐的眼泪。\n\n他们记起了一切——他们的游戏，他们的花园，他们的笑声。冰块拼成的谜题掉到了地上，被遗忘了。他们不需要解开一个冰冷、僵硬的谜题来寻找永恒。他们在他们的友谊中，在他们彼此的爱中找到了永恒。\n\n格尔达和凯手牵着手，离开了冰宫。当他们走着的时候，寒冷的风似乎变得温柔起来，雪花又开始欢快地飞舞。春天正在到来，即使是对雪后的领地也是如此。当他们终于回到自己的小镇时，他们小花箱里的玫瑰花正在盛开，比以往任何时候都更加鲜艳、更加红艳，欢迎他们回家。他们明白了，爱比任何冬天都温暖，比任何冰咒都强大。孩子们，这就是一个值得在冬日寒风中悄悄诉说的秘密。",

    "title": "The Frog Prince",
    "original": "Princess Lily loved to play in the royal gardens. Her favorite toy was a shiny, golden ball, as bright and cheerful as the sun.  Every afternoon, you could find her bouncing it high in the air, chasing after it with giggles echoing through the rose bushes.\n\nOne sunny day, Lily was playing near an old, deep well.  The well was made of stone, and it looked quite mysterious with its dark, still water.  Lily bounced her golden ball a little too high, and *plink!*  It bounced once, twice, and then disappeared right over the edge and into the well.\n\n\"Oh no!\" cried Lily. Her eyes filled with tears as she peered into the dark hole. She couldn't see her golden ball anywhere.  \"My beautiful ball!\" she sobbed. \"What will I do?\"\n\nSuddenly, a funny, gurgling voice called out from the well. \"Why are you crying, Princess Lily? Your tears are splashing down here!\"\n\nLily jumped back, surprised.  She looked around and then down into the well again.  Two big, round eyes peeked back at her from the dark water.  It was a frog! A big, green, slimy frog.\n\n\"It's you!\" Lily said, sniffing. \"My golden ball fell into the well, and now I can't get it back.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" croaked the frog, puffing out his throat. \"I might be able to help you get your ball back. But what will you give me in return?\"\n\nLily thought for a moment. What could she give a frog? \"Anything you want!\" she said quickly, just wanting her golden ball back. \"My jewels? My pretty dresses?  Anything!\"\n\nThe frog blinked his big eyes slowly. \"I don't want your jewels or your dresses,\" he said. \"I want to be your friend. I want to eat from your golden plate, drink from your golden cup, and sleep in your little bed.\"\n\nLily wrinkled her nose.  Eat with a frog? Sleep in her bed? That sounded a bit yucky. But she really, really wanted her golden ball back. \"Okay, okay,\" she said, \"You can be my friend. Just get me my ball!\"\n\nThe frog grinned, a wide, froggy grin.  He dove down into the well with a splash.  Lily waited and waited, tapping her foot impatiently. After what felt like a very long time, the frog popped back up, her golden ball in his mouth! He swam to the edge of the well and dropped the ball at Lily’s feet.\n\n\"Here you go!\" croaked the frog, pleased with himself.\n\n\"Oh, thank you!\" Lily cried, snatching up her ball. She was so happy to have it back that she completely forgot about her promise to the frog. She turned and ran back towards the castle, bouncing her golden ball happily. \"Goodbye, frog!\" she called over her shoulder, without even looking back.\n\nThe frog watched her go, his big eyes looking a little sad. He slowly hopped back into the well and disappeared under the water.\n\nThe next day, as Princess Lily was sitting down to dinner with her father, the King, there was a strange noise at the castle door.  *Knock, knock, knock!*  Loud and clear.\n\n\"Go see who that is,\" the King said to a servant.\n\nThe servant opened the door, and then quickly stepped back, looking very surprised and a little scared.  Standing there, right at the door, was the big, green, slimy frog!\n\n\"What is the meaning of this?\" the King asked, frowning.\n\nThe frog hopped closer and said in his croaky voice, \"Princess Lily, you promised me! Remember the well? You promised I could be your friend, eat from your plate, drink from your cup, and sleep in your bed!\"\n\nLily’s face turned as red as a ripe strawberry. She remembered her promise now, and she felt very ashamed.  She had promised the frog anything to get her ball back, but she hadn't really meant it.\n\nThe King looked at Lily, his eyebrows raised.  \"Lily, is this true? Did you make a promise to this frog?\"\n\nLily mumbled, \"Yes, Father, I did.\"\n\n\"A promise is a promise, Lily,\" the King said sternly but kindly. \"You must keep your word.  Let the frog in.\"\n\nLily sighed and reluctantly let the frog come to the table.  Oh, it was so embarrassing!  The frog hopped onto a chair beside her and started eating from her golden plate.  He slurped soup and gobbled up peas, making funny noises with every bite.  Lily hardly ate anything, she just watched the frog with a disgusted look.\n\nWhen it was time for bed, the frog said, \"I'm tired now. I want to sleep in your little bed, just like you promised.\"\n\nLily's face turned even redder.  Sleep in her bed with a slimy frog?  Yuck!  But the King insisted, \"You made a promise, Lily. Be kind and keep your word.\"\n\nSo, Lily very, very reluctantly carried the frog upstairs to her bedroom.  She put him on her pillow, as far away from her as possible.  \"Goodnight,\" she mumbled, turning her back to him and pulling the covers up to her chin.\n\nThe frog just croaked softly and settled down on the pillow.  Lily couldn’t sleep. She tossed and turned, feeling icky and unhappy. Finally, she couldn't take it anymore.  She sat up in bed and glared at the frog.\n\n\"You are the most disgusting, slimy, annoying creature!\" she said angrily.  And in her frustration, without really thinking, she picked up the frog and threw him as hard as she could against the wall!\n\n*BANG!*\n\nBut instead of a splat and a croak, there was a different sound.  Lily gasped.  Where the frog had been, now stood a handsome Prince! He had kind eyes and a friendly smile.\n\nThe Prince bowed to Lily. \"Don't be frightened, Princess Lily,\" he said. \"I was under a terrible spell cast by a wicked witch.  She turned me into a frog, and the spell could only be broken if a princess, despite her disgust, would be kind to me and let me be her companion.\"\n\nLily’s eyes widened in amazement.  \"You were the frog?\" she whispered.\n\n\"Yes,\" said the Prince. \"And you, Princess Lily, you kept your promise, even when it was difficult. You were kind and brave, even though you didn't want to be. You broke the witch's spell.\"\n\nLily looked at the Prince, and then at the spot where the frog had been. She couldn't believe her eyes.  The Prince was so kind and gentle, and not slimy at all!  She realized that sometimes, things are not always as they seem.\n\nThe Prince and Princess Lily talked for a long time that night.  They learned about each other and became good friends.  And because Lily had been kind and kept her promise, even when it was hard, the Prince and Princess fell in love.  Soon after, they were married in a grand wedding, and they lived happily ever after in the kingdom, always remembering the lesson of the frog in the well – that kindness and keeping your promises are always the most important things.",
    "translation": "莉莉公主最喜欢在王家花园里玩耍了。她最爱的玩具是一个亮闪闪的金球，像太阳一样明亮又快活。每天下午，你都能看到她把金球高高抛向空中，然后咯咯笑着追着它，笑声在玫瑰花丛中回荡。\n\n有一天阳光明媚的下午，莉莉在花园里玩，玩到了古老又深的井边。井是用石头砌成的，黑黑的井水静静的，看起来幽深神秘。莉莉一不小心，把金球抛得有点高，“咚！”的一声，金球弹了一下，又弹了一下，就滚过井沿，掉进了井里。\n\n“哎呀，不好！”莉莉叫了起来。她的眼睛里立刻盈满了泪水，她趴在井口，往黑洞洞的井里看。哪里都看不到她的金球。“我漂亮的金球啊！”她呜咽着，“我该怎么办呀？”\n\n突然，井里传来一个古怪的，咕噜咕噜的声音。“你哭什么呀，莉莉公主？你的眼泪都溅到我身上啦！”\n\n莉莉吓了一跳，往后跳了一步。她四处看了看，又往井里看去。两只圆溜溜的大眼睛正从黑水里望着她。原来是一只青蛙！一只又大又绿，还黏糊糊的青蛙。\n\n“是你呀！”莉莉抽泣着说，“我的金球掉到井里了，现在我拿不回来了。”\n\n“嗯……”青蛙鼓起腮帮子，呱呱地说，“也许我可以帮你把球捞上来。但是，你打算怎么报答我呢？”\n\n莉莉想了想。她能给青蛙什么呢？ “你想要什么都行！”她急忙说，她只想快点拿回她的金球。“我的珠宝？我漂亮的裙子？什么都行！”\n\n青蛙慢慢地眨了眨大眼睛。“我不要你的珠宝，也不要你的裙子，”他说，“我想和你做朋友。我想用你的金盘子吃饭，用你的金杯子喝水，还要睡在你的小床上。”\n\n莉莉皱了皱鼻子。和青蛙一起吃饭？睡在她的床上？这听起来有点……让人难受。但是她真的，真的非常想要回她的金球。“好吧好吧，”她说，“我可以和你做朋友。快点把我的球捞上来吧！”\n\n青蛙咧嘴一笑，露出青蛙式的笑容。他扑通一声跳进了井里。莉莉等啊等啊，不耐烦地跺着脚。感觉过了好久好久，青蛙又浮了上来，嘴里叼着她的金球！他游到井边，把球放在了莉莉的脚边。\n\n“给你！”青蛙呱呱地说，得意地说。\n\n“噢，谢谢你！”莉莉欢叫着，一把抓起她的金球。她太高兴球又回来了，完全忘记了她对青蛙的承诺。她转过身，朝着城堡跑去，开心地拍打着她的金球。“再见啦，青蛙！”她头也不回地朝身后喊了一声。\n\n青蛙看着她离开，大眼睛看起来有点伤心。他慢慢地跳回井里，消失在水面下。\n\n第二天，莉莉公主正和她的父王一起吃晚餐，城堡的门外传来一阵奇怪的声音。“咚咚咚！”声音又大又清楚。\n\n“去看看是谁来了。”国王对一个仆人说。\n\n仆人打开了门，连忙后退了几步，看起来又惊讶又有点害怕。站在那里，就在门口的，正是那只又大又绿，黏糊糊的青蛙！\n\n“这是怎么回事？”国王皱着眉头问道。\n\n青蛙跳到跟前，用他那沙哑的声音说：“莉莉公主，你答应过我的！你还记得井边吗？你答应过我可以做你的朋友，用你的盘子吃饭，用你的杯子喝水，睡在你的床上！”\n\n莉莉的脸一下子变得像熟透的草莓一样红。她现在想起来她答应过青蛙什么了，她感到非常羞愧。为了拿回她的球，她什么都答应了青蛙，但她其实根本就没当真。\n\n国王看着莉莉，挑起了眉毛。“莉莉，这是真的吗？你答应过这只青蛙什么吗？”\n\n莉莉小声嘟囔着：“是的，父王，我答应过。”\n\n“承诺就是承诺，莉莉，”国王严肃但又和蔼地说，“你必须遵守诺言。让青蛙进来吧。”\n\n莉莉叹了口气，不情愿地让青蛙来到餐桌边。哎呀，真是太丢人了！青蛙跳到她旁边的椅子上，开始用她的金盘子吃饭。他喝汤的时候发出吸溜吸溜的声音，吃豌豆的时候狼吞虎咽，每吃一口都发出奇怪的声音。莉莉几乎什么都没吃，只是 一脸嫌弃地看着青蛙。\n\n到了睡觉时间，青蛙说：“我现在困了。我想睡在你的小床上，就像你答应过的那样。”\n\n莉莉的脸变得更红了。和黏糊糊的青蛙一起睡在她的床上？真恶心！但是国王坚持说：“你答应过的，莉莉。要善良，要遵守你的诺言。”\n\n所以，莉莉非常非常不情愿地把青蛙抱上楼，带到她的卧室。她把他放在枕头上，尽可能地离自己远一点。“晚安，”她嘟囔着说，转过身背对着他，把被子拉到下巴。\n\n青蛙轻轻地呱呱叫了一声，然后在枕头上安顿下来。莉莉睡不着。她翻来覆去，觉得浑身难受，一点也不开心。最后，她再也受不了了。她坐起身，怒视着青蛙。\n\n“你真是最恶心，最黏糊糊，最讨厌的家伙！”她生气地说。在气恼之下，她没有多想，抓起青蛙，用尽全身力气把他朝墙上扔去！\n\n“砰！”但是，并没有听到“啪”的一声和青蛙的叫声，而是另一种声音。莉莉倒吸一口凉气。刚才青蛙待的地方，现在站着一位英俊的王子！他有着温柔的眼神和友善的笑容。\n\n王子向莉莉鞠了一躬。“别害怕，莉莉公主，”他说，“我中了恶毒女巫的可怕咒语。她把我变成了青蛙，只有一位公主，即使觉得我很恶心，仍然对我友善，并且愿意让我做她的伙伴，这个咒语才能被解除。”\n\n莉莉惊讶地睁大了眼睛。“你……你就是那只青蛙？”她轻声问道。\n\n“是的，”王子说，“而你，莉莉公主，你遵守了你的诺言，即使这很困难。你善良又勇敢，即使你并不情愿。你解除了女巫的咒语。”\n\n莉莉看着王子，又看了看刚才青蛙待过的地方。她简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。王子是如此的善良和温柔，一点也不黏糊糊！她意识到，有时候，事情并不像表面看起来那样。\n\n王子和莉莉公主那天晚上聊了很久很久。他们互相了解，成为了好朋友。因为莉莉很善良，并且遵守了诺言，即使这很困难，王子和公主相爱了。不久之后，他们举行了盛大的婚礼，从此以后，他们在这个王国里过上了幸福的生活，并且永远记着井里的青蛙教给他们的道理——善良和遵守诺言永远是最重要的。",
